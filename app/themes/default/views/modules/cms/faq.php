                <strong>Passport</strong>: Your passport must be valid for at
                least 6 months from the outbound date of travel. All travelers
                must have individual passports including children and
                infants.<br /><strong>Visa</strong>: You must be in possession
                of a valid visa for countries that do not facilitate visa on
                arrival. You may require travel insurance and a pre-determined
                amount of foreign currency to qualify for a visa to certain
                countries. Check with the consulate of the country you're
                visiting to ensure what your visa requirements will be.<br /><strong
                  >Transit Visa</strong
                >: Some countries require you to have a valid transit visa even
                if you’re not stopping by. For instance, Saudi nationals flying
                to Canada via any of the US airports will need to hold a valid
                US transit visa. Entry and transit requirements are subject to
                change and you are advised to check the requirements prior to
                travel.<br /><strong>Foreign currency</strong>: Check the
                foreign currency requirements for the country you’re visiting.
                Sometimes there is a minimum currency requirement and in most
                cases, one should be in possession of a credit card that can be
                used internationally.<br /><strong>Vaccination</strong>: The
                yellow fever vaccination is the only compulsory vaccination
                required when visiting countries in South America and Africa.
                This vaccination needs to be taken 10 days prior to entry in any
                of the yellow fever affected areas. On return to your home
                country, you may be asked to produce your yellow fever
                vaccination certification. If you don’t have one, you’ll be kept
                in quarantine for about 6 days. To find out where the yellow
                fever vaccination centers in Saudi Arabia are, please contact
                the Ministry of Health directly here.
